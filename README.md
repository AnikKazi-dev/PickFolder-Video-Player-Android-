# PickFolder Player

A privacy-focused Flutter video player app for Android with **specific folder selection** - the most secure way to manage your video library!

## Why PickFolder Player?

**Most video players force you to grant access to ALL your files and folders!**

Unlike traditional video players that require complete storage access (potentially exposing all your private files), **PickFolder Player** uses Android's Storage Access Framework (SAF) to let you:

- **Select ONLY specific folders** you want to play videos from  
- **Keep your privacy intact** - No access to your documents, photos, or other folders  
- **Better security** - The app can only see what you explicitly allow  
- **No broad storage permissions** - Works with Android's modern scoped storage

**This is the ONLY video player that prioritizes your privacy by requesting access to specific folders only!**

---

## Features

- **Secure Folder Selection**: Select specific folders using Android's built-in folder picker
- **Shuffle Mode**: Randomize video playback order with one tap
- **Autoplay**: Automatically play the next video in the queue
- **Full-Featured Player**: Professional video player with:
  - Play/Pause controls
  - Seek bar with scrubbing
  - Previous/Next video navigation
  - Time display
  - Tap to show/hide controls
- **Persistent Settings**: Remembers your folder selection, shuffle, and autoplay preferences
- **Modern UI**: Clean, Material Design 3 interface
- **Dark Theme**: Easy on the eyes
